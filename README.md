# Rhythm-Pong

This projet is a remake of my old Rhythm Pong created in July 2019.

This version is made with Unity in C# and this is my firt Unity project.

## This is not a game but a simple visual experiment, the improvement made between this version and the old Java / LWJGL one is :
- Visual improvement (Better shader, better particles effect, ball trail, ...).
- Physics improvement, now the ball can't go through player and cause some song desync.
- New component like the middle gravity making the ball curve.
- Better ghost ball calcul
- Player now unable to score point
